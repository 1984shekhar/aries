This is the new Apache Aries site content
==========================================

Here is what I did to create it.

1) Branched the old site and created the new site structure as specififed

2) Extracted the cwiki contenet using the export-site.pl tool.
 To run this I had to install some extra perl modules:

   sudo port install p5-crypt-ssleay
   sudo port install  p5-libwww-perli
   sudo port install  p5-rpc-xml

These are Mac specific Darwin ports commands, could also have installed from CPAN.

This generates the site content as *.mdtext files - but also leaves the cwiki files for reference

3) Next step is to build the site using the build tools.

First check the cms build tools out of SVN.
To run the build_site.pl script I had to:

rm lib/Dotiac/DTL/Addon/markup.pl from teh build tools directory, then install:

sudo perl -MCPAN -e "install Dotiac::DTL"
sudo cpan Dotiac::DTL::Addon::markup

Also need to take a guess at what the site template shoudl be like. I copied comdev's.

4) Check the site on a local server.

The template needed a lot of fixing.
The navigation needed some very specific fixing of the mdtext file.
The site (mainly links) also still need a lot of fixing.
